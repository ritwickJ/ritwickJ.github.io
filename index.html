						<h1>About me</h1>

						<p style="text-align: justify;">I am passionate about solving problems that few others can. 
							I love being able to think on my own and come up with original and creative ways to solve complex problems. 
							I like healthy competition and I want to find out the utmost potential of my capabilities by challenging myself 
							by being my own competition.
							<br>
							<br>
							I graduated from the University of Sheffield with an integrated Master's in computer science. 
							It was a four year degree with the first three years having Bachelor level modules and the fourth year 
							was taught at a Master's level. 
							I achieved an overall average of 82% in my final year and graduated with a first class honours. 
							I discovered my interest in ML/AI during my second year of university and 
							took as many machine learning and artificial intelligence modules as possible throughout the degree. 
							My interest in this field is due to my fondness of mathematics combined with the vast opportunities of
							discovering novel aspects of well established problems. There is a lot of freedom to explore and innovate. 
							I am especially fascinated with how artificial intelligence can be inspired by human cognition.
							<br>
							<br>
							Apart from excelling in academics, university was a great opportunity to meet new people and gather
							experiences from all cultures. One of the most fulfilling experiences at university was being a core member 
							of the university Futsal team (5-a side football) for three years. 
							We competed at a national level in the all-university league (BUCS) and finished second. 
							It was also very exciting to play against our rivals in the inter-university tournament and win while 
							fellow students cheered us on.
